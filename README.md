# discordRPG v0.8
NOTE: THIS IS BLATANTLY OUTDATED AND HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED IN FOREVER. IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A LOT OF FRONT-END CHANGES.

RPG for Discord.

This project is essentially supposed to create a text-based MMORPG-style game (specifically taking inspiration from aspects of Runescape), playable by any and all.

# Current Features:

*Skills*: Mining, Woodcutting, and Fighting included by default! All of these three give experience, and have skill levels calculated.

*Refineries*: Smelt ores, carve wood, craft pendants! Gives experience to skills as well.

*Shops*: Buy, value, and sell items! The wares available are dependant on rank, but not randomized yet.

*Inventory Management*: You can equip items, unequip items, and manage your inventory.

*Weather*: Ambient weather! No longer has an effect on skills, but we're trying to figure it out again!

*Trading*: Trade with other players! Floating trading inventory keeps track of both players' items, and counts the value for you! Once one player has confirmed, you're protected by the other player losing the ability to add or remove items from the trade!

*Customizability*: You can create, delete, and edit floors, events, refineries, and even commands! With just a few simple commands, you can create a new event, tie the event to a new command, and start using it!

# Project Goal:
To create a bot which works as an MMORPG host for Discord, and make it easy to fork and customize to your liking both through code and Discord commands!

# Discord Server:
discord server has been killed.
